Bad Apple is an Atari 2600 game coded in 6502 assembly language. What is included in this repository is a manual on how to play the game, the assembly code used to create the game, and a bin file to allow one to play the game using any Atari 2600 emulation software. The goal of the game in terms of gameplay is to catch apples endlessly to fill up your score. The goal of what I wanted to accomplish from designing the game is to be as faithful as possible to the Atari 2600 aesthetic while also producing a game built upon the limitations of a system that is several decades old.
